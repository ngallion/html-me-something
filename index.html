                    <h2>Tea Bagging</h2>
                    <p>
                            &emsp;Since a young age, I have enjoyed the fruits of the revered herb <em>Camellia Sinensis</em>.
                        Up until age 20, I knew it only as the crushed-up leaves in a piece of folded-up and stapled 
                        filter paper (tea bag). My first favorite tea was the ever-popular Earl Grey, which I would brew in a coffee cup
                        in the microwave (for one minute) and add roughly 25-50% cold milk, and almost
                        as much granulated sugar.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                            &emsp;I dabbled with other types--ginger to ease the stomach, green for a light taste, and various other fruit infused varieties.
                        I recall often enjoying iced black tea on many a hot summer day (again, profusely sweetened.)
                        But, for the first part of my life, when I thought of tea, I imagined the taste of sugary, milky earl grey. They were
                        simpler times.

                    <h2>The Reign of Coffee</h2>
                    <p>
                            &emsp;Beginning sometime around age 18, I was introduced to the miraculous wonders of the coffee bean. While coffee is certainly
                        <b>not</b> tea, I would consider it a stop on my "voyage" into tea. I began with sugared up Starbucks concoctions, but
                        gradually descended into home brewing--the deeper I descended, the darker my cups turned, until I was drinking
                        pure, unadulturated, black bean water (which is still my preference). Eventually I found myself making americanos with
                        an <a href="https://aeropressinc.com/aeropress/">Aeropress</a> every morning before work.
                        Coffee holds a special place in my heart, but I've found that it is quite the double-edged sword. Caffeine
                         dependency is no joke. I found myself relying too much on its abilities to wake me up, so I decided to take a break and 
                        pursue other, less potent forms of alertness enablers.

                    <h2>Loosening Up</h2>
                    <p>
                            &emsp;I took some time off coffee and explored other avenues of caffeine administration. I stumbled across
                        an old ball diffuser I had received as a gift a few years prior, and looked into loose leaf teas.
                        I tried a few black teas, hoping for a higher caffeine content over greens and tisanes (tea-talk for fruit infusions). 
                        After browsing several local stores,
                        I found a few brands I liked, and a few I didn't (looking at you, Lipton). Eventually, I took my shopping 
                        online and found some excellent brands (shout-out to <a href="http://www.uptontea.com/">Upton Tea Imports</a>).
                        Earl Grey was a mainstay for a while, but I also explored teas from Yunnan and Darjeeling. I began to wonder where
                        all these fancy names came from! After some researching, I unearthed a wealth of internet knowledge
                        regarding different tea locales, along with various forms of "oxidation"--whatever that meant. I continued
                        to explore these different origins, though stuck entirely to black/highly oxidized leaves. Eventually I evolved 
                        from the ball diffuser to a rustic tea pot, which allowed the leaves to breathe and diffuse more 
                        elegant flavors. But my obsession with the sacred shrub was only beginning.

                    <h2>Finding My Match-a</h2>
                    <p>
                            &emsp;Matcha. This delectable powdered marvel played a key role in expanding my concept of tea. Matcha consists
                        of finely ground young green tea leaves, which are then added to hot water and whisked in a bowl to form a
                        thick, frothy tea soup. It contains high levels of theanine, and a moderate amount of caffeine, which, in unison,
                        produce a clear-headed, zen-like energy boost. While a delightful warm beverage, what makes it most significant
                        to me is how it awakened me to the existence of "tea culture". This particular type of tea has
                        a long history in Japanese culture. There are matcha ceremonies, in which "tea masters" brew high quality
                        tea using techniques and rituals that have been honed for several generations, in a custom that has its
                        base in both Tao and Buddhist traditions. I then discovered that there were other "tea cultures"--in fact,
                        almost every country or region has their own! As my fascination became an obsession, I turned my eyes toward
                        inland Asia, to China, whose history with tea is thought to go back as far as 2700 BC. In doing so, I discovered
                        the art of gong fu.

                    <h2>Gong Fu Master</h2>
                    <p>
                            &emsp;My research on tea rituals quickly turned up results for a curious method of brewing tea
                            called 'Gongfu'. This type of brewing is different from the western style, which uses high temperatures
                            and longer steeping times (which yields a more bitter product, hence the heavy use of sweetener being
                            a common practice). It relies on using smaller amounts of tea and water, using several shorter steeps.
                            The result is a naturally sweeter, more complex flavor. Upon reading of this brewing style, I knew I
                            had to try it, so I procured myself a cheap 'Gaiwan', and bought some samples of a strong fermented tea called
                            Pu'er (pronounced pOO-air). When all the goods arrived, I was eager to try it out...and the results were astounding!
                            The tea had flavors I had never tasted before, and the mental effects from the unique blend of over 200 effective
                            psychoactive molecules present in the leaves was shocking. At higher temperatures, many of these compounds break down,
                            but at the lower temperatures they are easily metabolized by the body. This was better than coffee, and, after
                            some experimentation, I found that frequent usage did not result in the same dependency effect that occured
                            with coffee (no headaches or tiredness when abstaining).

                    <p>
                            &emsp;In Chinese culture, the act of brewing the tea is as significant as the drink it produces. To brew
                            in such a way requires focus, precision, and a sort of scientific curiosity, a willingness to try out new
                            things that may influence what flavors end up in your cup. This is where I fell in love. No two cups
                            are the same, even in the same brewing session. Small changes (allowing to steep 5 more seconds, or 5&deg; cooler)
                            yield a different flavor. The act of brewing becomes a form of moving meditation. Those first few weeks
                            of discovering what worked and what did not were an exciting time!

                    <h2>A Whole New World (of Tea)</h2>
                    <p>
                            &emsp;This brings us to present day! Most mornings, my routine involves waking up about 30 minutes earlier
                            to give myself time to enjoy a good gongfu session. I have found that it brings a sort of tranquility to 
                            my day, and encourages a state of mindfulness. Since that first sample pack of Pu'er, I have branched out to
                            other teas intended for gongfu brewing, including oolong, white, various strong green teas. I am currently
                            working my way through a pack of sencha, which is a green tea that is very popular in Japan. My experiences
                            with tea bring me such joy, and I look forward to what discoveries I will make in the future!
