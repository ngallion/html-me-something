                    <h2>Tea Bagging</h2>
                    <p>
                        Since a young age, I have enjoyed the fruits of the revered herb <em>Camellia Sinensis</em>.
                        Up until age 20, I knew it only as the crushed-up leaves in a piece of folded-up and stapled 
                        filter paper (tea bag). My first favorite tea was the ever-popular Earl Grey, which I would brew in a coffee cup
                        in the microwave (for one minute) and add roughly 25-50% cold milk, and almost
                        as much granulated sugar.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I dabbled with other types--ginger to ease the stomach, green for a light taste, and various other fruit infused varieties.
                        But, for the first part of my life, when I thought of tea, I imagined the taste of sugary, milky earl grey. They were
                        simpler times.

                    <h2>The Reign of Coffee</h2>
                    <p>
                        Beginning sometime around age 18, I was introduced to the miraculous wonders of the coffee bean. While coffee is certainly
                        <b>not</b> tea, I would consider it a stop on my "voyage" into tea. I began with sugared up Starbucks concoctions, but
                        gradually descended into home brewing--the deeper I descended, my cups slowly turned darker and darker, till I was drinking
                        pure, unadulturated black bean water (which is still my preference). Eventually I found myself making americanos with
                        an <a href="https://aeropressinc.com/aeropress/">Aeropress</a> every morning before work.
                        Coffee holds a special place in my heart, but I've found that it is quite the double-edged sword. Caffeine
                         dependency is no joke. I found myself relying too much on its abilities to wake me up, so I decided to take a break and 
                        pursue other, less potent forms of alertness enablers.
