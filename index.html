                    <h2>Tea Bagging</h2>
                    <p>
                        Since a young age, I have enjoyed the fruits of the revered herb <em>Camellia Sinensis</em>.
                        Up until age 20, I knew it only as the crushed-up leaves in a piece of folded-up and stapled 
                        filter paper (tea bag). My first favorite tea was the ever-popular Earl Grey, which I would brew in a coffee cup
                        in the microwave (for one minute) and add roughly 25-50% cold milk, and almost
                        as much granulated sugar.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I dabbled with other types--ginger to ease the stomach, green for a light taste, and various other fruit infused varieties.
                        But, for the first part of my life, when I thought of tea, I imagined the taste of sugary, milky earl grey. They were
                        simpler times.

                    <h2>The Reign of Coffee</h2>
                    <p>
                        Beginning sometime around age 18, I was introduced to the miraculous wonders of the coffee bean. While coffee is certainly
                        <b>not</b> tea, I would consider it a stop on my "voyage" into tea. I began with sugared up Starbucks concoctions, but
                        gradually descended into home brewing--the deeper I descended, the darker my cups turned, until I was drinking
                        pure, unadulturated, black bean water (which is still my preference). Eventually I found myself making americanos with
                        an <a href="https://aeropressinc.com/aeropress/">Aeropress</a> every morning before work.
                        Coffee holds a special place in my heart, but I've found that it is quite the double-edged sword. Caffeine
                         dependency is no joke. I found myself relying too much on its abilities to wake me up, so I decided to take a break and 
                        pursue other, less potent forms of alertness enablers.

                    <h2>Loosening Up</h2>
                    <p>
                        I took some time off coffee and explored other avenues of caffeine administration. I stumbled across
                        an old ball diffuser I had received as a gift a few years prior, and looked into loose leaf teas.
                        I tried a few black teas, hoping for a higher caffeine content over greens and tisanes (tea-talk for fruit infusions). 
                        After browsing several local stores,
                        I found a few brands I liked, and a few I didn't (looking at you, Lipton). Eventually, I took my shopping 
                        online and found some excellent brands (shout-out to <a href="http://www.uptontea.com/">Upton Tea Imports</a>).
                        Earl Grey was a mainstay for a while, but I also explored teas from Yunnan and Darjeeling. I began to wonder where
                        all these fancy names came from! After some researching, I unearthed a wealth of internet knowledge
                        regarding different tea locales, along with various forms of "oxidation"--whatever that meant. I continued
                        to explore these different origins, though stuck entirely to black/highly oxidized leaves. Eventually I evolved 
                        from the ball diffuser to a rustic tea pot, which allows the leaves to breathe more and diffuse more 
                        elegant flavors. But my obsession with the sacred shrub was only beginning.
